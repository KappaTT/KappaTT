# KappaTT

Kappa was an iniative started by Jeff Taylor-Chang, the Web Chair of the Kappa chapter of Theta Tau from 2019 to 2021, in the Spring of 2020. The goal was to create a new way to manage and track the fraternity. Originally events were tracked in a Google Calendar and Facebook group with attendance done via Google Sheets and Forms, and voting was done through a custom websocket based voting platform. Kappa consolidates everything into a single service for mobile and desktop that allows brothers to view event information, automatically tracks attendance, excused absences, calculates points live, and even handles voting on rushes and pledges.

Kappa consists of an iOS app, Android app, PWA for mobile, desktop site, serverless backend hosted on AWS Lambda, a repository of useful scripts to interact with Google Drive, and a CLI which supports special features like backing up the service automatically.
